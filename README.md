🚭 An app that uses the **exposure therapy** method to reduce smoking **without anxiety**.

🕒 Do you find yourself reaching for a cigarette **every 30 minutes**? This app won't judge you. Instead, it will gently increase your cooldown between cigarettes by as little as **1 minute a day**. Over time, you'll notice a significant reduction in the number of cigarettes you smoke, all while minimizing anxiety.

🤗 The app's primary goal is to create a supportive environment for individuals who want to quit smoking. It's about making **small, sustainable changes** that lead to a big transformation in your life.

## Key Features
