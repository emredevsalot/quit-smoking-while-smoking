🚭 An app that uses the **exposure therapy** method to reduce smoking **without anxiety**.

🕒 Do you find yourself reaching for a cigarette **every 30 minutes**? This app won't judge you. Instead, it will gently increase your cooldown between cigarettes by as little as **1 minute a day**. Over time, you'll notice a significant reduction in the number of cigarettes you smoke, all while minimizing anxiety.

🤗 The app's primary goal is to create a supportive environment for individuals who want to quit smoking. It's about making **small, sustainable changes** that lead to a big transformation in your life.

## Key Features

**😌 Anxiety-Free:** Quit smoking at your own pace without the pressure of strict goals.<br/>
**🤝 Supportive Environment:** The app provides a supportive and non-judgmental space to help you quit smoking.<br/>

## Contributing & Publishing

Right now, I'm only using the app with the APK below. I'm not in a place to be able to publish the app to the App Store and Google Play.

If anyone is interested in or already publishing such self-improvement apps in these platforms, please reach out to me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emredevsalot/) or [Twitter.](https://twitter.com/emredevsalot)

(App is not and will not be monetized with IAP, it's for a good cause, if we can get them to the stores, I want to make a ProductHunt launch, then it might be beneficial for a couple of people at least.)

## If you want to try it out (Android)

Here's the [latest APK](https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/kiyP8cE4AxuubYxusWxPE6.apk) that's been generated with Expo EAS.
